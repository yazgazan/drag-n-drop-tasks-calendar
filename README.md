# Todoist Drag & Drop Calendar

A React-based task management interface that integrates with the Todoist API to provide an intuitive drag-and-drop experience for scheduling tasks.

## Current Status

This project is currently in active development. The core infrastructure is in place with a functional drag-and-drop interface and Todoist API integration. See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for current development priorities.

## Overview

This application provides a modern interface for managing your Todoist tasks with two main components:

1. **Unscheduled Tasks List** - A comprehensive list of tasks that haven't been scheduled yet
2. **Calendar View** - A visual calendar where tasks can be scheduled by dragging and dropping

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **API Integration**: Direct integration with Todoist REST API v2
- **Styling**: CSS modules with modern CSS features

## Key Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **Drag & Drop Interface** - Smooth drag interactions between task list and calendar
- **Todoist API Integration** - Authentication and task fetching from Todoist
- **React Component Architecture** - Modular, maintainable component structure
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and development experience
- **Modern Build Pipeline** - Vite-powered development and build process

### ðŸš§ In Development
- **Real Date Integration** - Currently uses generic weekdays, needs actual date calculations
- **Task Date Updates** - API calls to update task due dates when dropped on calendar
- **Calendar Navigation** - Week/month navigation controls
- **Task Editing** - Direct task modification capabilities

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- **Multiple Calendar Views** - Week and month view modes
- **Offline Support** - localStorage caching for offline functionality
- **Enhanced Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and E2E test coverage
