# Bug Report: Mobile Drag-and-Drop Not Working

## Issue Description
Drag-and-drop functionality works perfectly on desktop but fails to update tasks on mobile devices. The touch drag system detects all events correctly (touch start, drag threshold, drop target identification, and drag end), but the actual task update does not occur.

## Evidence from Logs
From the mobile test logs, we can see:

1. ✅ **Touch events are detected correctly**
   - Touch start: `Touch start detected` with proper coordinates
   - Drag threshold: `Drag threshold exceeded, starting drag` 
   - Drop target detection: Multiple `Finding drop target` and `Drop target found` entries

2. ✅ **Touch drag system completes successfully**
   - Final log: `Touch drag end` with proper drop target data
   - Callbacks are being called: `Calling callbacks` with both local and global callbacks present

3. ❌ **Missing handleDrop execution logs**
   - Expected log `DROP_HANDLER handleDrop called` is NOT present in the logs
   - This suggests the `handleDrop` function is never executed

## Root Cause Analysis

### Key Finding
The touch drag system successfully identifies drop targets and calls callbacks, but the `handleDrop` function (which performs the actual task update) is not being executed.

### Investigation Steps Taken

1. **Examined touch drag callback implementation** (`src/utils/touchDragUtils.ts:165-177`)
   - Confirmed callbacks are being called correctly
   - Both local and global `onDragEnd` callbacks are invoked

2. **Analyzed synthetic event creation** (`src/App.tsx:472-508`)
   - Synthetic React DragEvent is properly constructed
   - Target property is correctly set to the drop target element

3. **Added detailed logging** (`src/App.tsx:511-522`)
   - Added try-catch around `handleDrop` call
   - Added logging before and after `handleDrop` execution
   - Added synthetic event target verification logs

## Current Status
- ✅ Enhanced logging has been added to capture more details
- ⏳ Need to test with new logging to identify the exact failure point

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test mobile drag-and-drop with enhanced logging**
   - Look for new logs: "About to call handleDrop from touch manager"
   - Check if "handleDrop called successfully" or error logs appear

2. **Analyze enhanced log output to determine**:
   - Is `handleDrop` being called at all?
   - Are there any JavaScript errors preventing execution?
   - Is the synthetic event properly formed?

### Potential Solutions Based on Investigation Results

#### If handleDrop is not being called:
- Check if the callback reference is properly maintained
- Verify useCallback dependencies are correct
- Investigate potential React state closure issues

#### If handleDrop is called but fails silently:
- Check for errors in the drop target identification logic
- Verify the synthetic event target properties match expected format
- Investigate async/await error handling in the drop handler

#### If handleDrop executes but task update fails:
- Check Todoist API call execution
- Verify task state updates are properly triggered
- Investigate optimistic update rollback scenarios

### Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx`: Added enhanced logging around `handleDrop` execution (lines 511-522)

### Test Requirements
- Test on actual mobile device with developer tools/remote debugging
- Capture full console logs during drag-and-drop operation
- Verify network requests are made to Todoist API

## Technical Context
- Touch drag system: Custom implementation in `src/utils/touchDragUtils.ts`
- Drop handler: `handleDrop` function in `src/App.tsx:187`
- Event bridging: Synthetic React DragEvent created to bridge touch events to drag events
- Task updates: Todoist API calls via REST API v2

## Priority
**HIGH** - Core functionality broken on mobile devices, significantly impacting user experience.
